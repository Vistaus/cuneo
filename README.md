Cuneo is a simple and straightforward app that lets you calculate and convert anything you might encounter in your daily life. Being designed like a widget, Cuneo gets out of the way and is best used floating over a maximized window so you can focus on your actual tasks and not managing a calculation app covering half your screen.

<h2> Info </h2>
Cuneo's name is inspired by the ancient writing system cuneiform. It is the earliest known wiritng system that's been originally used by the Sumer civilization. One use case for cuneiform was on numerical tablets likely to keep track of taxes, inventory, calculations and many other things people encountered in their daily lives. This is what Cuneo basically is. Cuneo is meant to be used "on-site". For when you need to get something done or look something up really quick. Designed like a tool that lives in your pocket which you get out when you need to crunch some numbers or conversions.
<br><br>
Cuneo features two distinct modes: a regular calculation mode and a conversion mode. To help you stay focused and avoid wasting any of your precious screen space, Cuneo skips the usual skeuomorphic calculator buttons. You just use the numbers on your keyboard, they're right there after all. For anything a little more complicated than your keyboard can handle theres an operator menu right at your disposal. Power users can also just type the operators like "sqrt()" for square root. 
<br><br>
Conversion mode is a powerful conversion multi-tool that offers many different units to convert to and from. Unit types range from Area to Volume and Units inside these categories are grouped by common affiliation like metric and imperial.
